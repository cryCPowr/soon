## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a platform designed to integrate blockchain technology, NFTs, and staking mechanisms, creating a unique environment for users. By staking tokens, users will be able to mint customizable NFTs that evolve over time, while also receiving rewards based on their engagement. This innovative system aims to provide both utility and engagement through age-based NFT updates, staking rewards, and a market liquidity model. We are seeking a grant to fund the development and deployment of this platform.

## 2. Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- **Facilitate NFT Minting**: Allow users to mint NFTs based on token staking, with the NFT reflecting the user's age at the time of minting.
- **Reward Long-Term Engagement**: Create a staking reward system where users receive daily rewards based on their stake, encouraging long-term participation.
- **Penalties for Early Withdrawal**: Introduce a penalty system for early withdrawal of staked tokens, with the platform benefiting from these penalties.
- **Age-Based NFT Evolution**: Enable users to update their NFTs as they age, offering a personalized experience that evolves with time.
- **Liquidity in CEX**: Ensure that staked tokens become liquid on centralized exchanges (CEX), providing flexibility for users.

## 3. Platform Features

### 3.1. Token Staking & NFT Minting

Users will need to stake tokens to mint an NFT. The staked tokens will be locked and cannot be withdrawn until a user-specified date, with the NFT reflecting the userâ€™s age at the time of minting.

### 3.2. Reward System

The platform will reward users daily from a fee-based reward pool. The reward is proportional to the amount of tokens staked and the duration of staking.

### 3.3. Penalties for Early Withdrawal

If users choose to withdraw tokens before the staking period ends, they will face a penalty, which reduces their token amount. This penalty will contribute to the development fund.

### 3.4. Age-Based NFT Updates

The platform will offer users the ability to update their NFTs based on their age. As users age, the NFT will be updated, and users will be able to manage and refresh the design of their NFT through a dedicated web platform.

### 3.5. Market Liquidity

Staked tokens will become liquid on CEX platforms, ensuring that users can trade their tokens even before the staking period ends, while still benefiting from staking rewards.

## 4. Tokenomics

- **Token Supply**: A fixed total supply of tokens will be established to ensure value retention.
- **Reward Distribution**: A portion of the transaction fees will be allocated to the reward pool for staking users.
- **Penalty Fees**: A percentage of penalties from early withdrawals will be used to support platform development and sustainability.
